# Enron Email Dataset – Big Data Analysis
This project explores the Enron Email Dataset using Apache Spark on Databricks, demonstrating scalable data processing techniques for semi-structured data. 
The goal is to extract actionable insights from email metadata, such as sender-receiver patterns and communication frequencies, using distributed computing tools. 
It is designed to showcase real-world big data engineering and analytics skills applicable in enterprise environments.

## Dataset
The Enron email dataset contains a large volume of emails from the Enron Corporation. 
This project focuses on extracting insights from the dataset using **Apache Spark** and **Python**.

## Objectives
- Load,extract and transform the Enron email dataset on Databricks.
- Answer analytical questions such as:
  - How many unique recipients are there?
  - Who are the top email senders?
  - What are the most common communication patterns?
- Apply filters, transformations, and aggregations using PySpark.

##  Technologies Used
- **Databricks Notebooks**
- **Apache Spark**
- **DBFS (Databricks File System)**
- **Python (PySpark)**
- **RDD**
- **Dataframes**
- **Visualization Insights**

## Overview
Tasks are categorized by difficulty:
- **Easy**: Basic counts and filters (e.g., count of unique recipients).
- **Medium**: Intermediate aggregations and email parsing.
- **Hard**: More complex insights or custom logic.

## Conclusion
- This project illustrates the practical application of big data technologies to real-world organizational communication data. 
- By leveraging Apache Spark on Databricks, the analysis efficiently processed hundreds of thousands of emails, uncovering patterns in sender-receiver behavior, subject line themes, and time-based activity spikes. 
- Visualizations such as bar charts, word clouds, and time-series plots enhanced interpretability and storytelling.
- The project demonstrates core competencies in distributed data processing, text mining, and data visualization, making it a strong portfolio example for roles in data engineering, analytics, and enterprise data science
